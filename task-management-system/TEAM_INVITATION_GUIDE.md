## Email Template

As a team member, you will have view access to the project and be able to submit updates.

```

## Database Collections

The system uses two new MongoDB collections:

### ProjectInvitations
Stores all invitation records:
- Invitation ID
- Project details
- Sender information
- Recipient email
- Status (Pending, Accepted, Declined, Expired)
- Role (Viewer)
- Timestamps

### ProjectMembers
Stores active project memberships:
- Member ID
- Project ID
- User details (ID, email, name)
- Role
- Join date
- Added by user ID

## API Endpoints

## Error Handling

The system prevents common issues:

‚ùå **"User with this email does not exist in the system"**
- Solution: The user must create an account first

‚ùå **"An invitation has already been sent to this user"**
- Solution: Wait for the user to respond or for the invitation to expire

‚ùå **"This user is already a member of the project"**
- Solution: No need to invite again

‚ùå **"Invalid or expired invitation"**
- Solution: Request a new invitation from the project owner
